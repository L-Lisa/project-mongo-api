# Mongo API Project

Learning Mongo-Db, Heroku, Express, seeding databases and creating good endpoints. 

## The problem

After working only front end it feels odd doing only the backend, I am very much looking forward to connecting the two! Would have liked more time to do better error handling in this one..
